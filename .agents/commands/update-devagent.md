# Update DevAgent (Command)

## Instructions

1. Run the DevAgent core update script located at `.devagent/core/scripts/update-core.sh` to update core files, commands, and skills from the DevAgent repository.

2. After the script completes successfully, provide a summary of what was updated, including:
   - Which directories were updated (`.devagent/core/`, `.agents/commands/`, `.claude/skills/`)
   - Any specific skills or commands that were updated
   - Any backup information (if kept)
   - Note that changes were NOT committed (as per user preference)

3. Do NOT commit the changes to git. The script may suggest committing, but you should only report what was updated.
