{"id":"devagent-gc4.2","title":"Hide LogViewer for Inactive Agents Without Logs","description":"Improve UX by hiding the LogViewer component for agents that are inactive or finished when no log file exists. Currently the component always renders with a 'No logs available' placeholder message. Since log persistence is out of scope, we should conditionally render the LogViewer only for active agents or agents with existing logs. This prevents confusing UI elements for completed tasks.","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2026-01-16T16:10:35.581954-06:00","updated_at":"2026-01-18T16:51:30.484518-06:00","closed_at":"2026-01-16T16:15:35.065263-06:00","created_by":"Jake Ruesink","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"devagent-gc4.2","depends_on_id":"devagent-gc4","type":"parent-child","created_at":"2026-01-16T16:10:35.582535-06:00","created_by":"Jake Ruesink"}]}
