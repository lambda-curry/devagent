An investigation identified 25 instances of `useState`/`useRef`/`useEffect` that could be better handled by React Router 7's built-in features, missing error handling patterns using the framework-native `data()` helper, incomplete route type safety, and no testing infrastructure. This plan adopts reportory's proven cursor rules and refactors code to follow React Router 7 best practices, improving type safety, error handling, state management, and testability.\n\nFinal Quality Gates:\n- All tests passing (bun run test)\n- Lint clean (bun run lint)\n- Typecheck passing (bun run typecheck)\n","status":"open","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","owner":"jake@lambdacurry.dev","created_at":"2026-01-15T15:58:05.622162-06:00","created_by":"Jake Ruesink","updated_at":"2026-01-15T15:58:07.184321-06:00"}
