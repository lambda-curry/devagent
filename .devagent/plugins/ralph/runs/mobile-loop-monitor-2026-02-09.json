    "description": "Redesign ralph-monitoring as a mobile-first loop monitoring experience. Three core screens: (1) Loop Dashboard — quick-glance list of active loops with status/progress, (2) Loop Detail — live 'what's happening now' view with current task, recent activity feed, and all-steps list, (3) Live Log — full-screen streaming log viewer.\n\nThis replaces the previous mobile epic activity approach (PR #99) which added data cards but missed the UX redesign. The new approach is phone-first: optimized for checking in on the go.\n\nExisting code to reuse:\n- Server utils from codex/2026-02-03-mobile-epic-activity-view branch (epic-activity.server.ts, epic-metadata.server.ts) — cherry-pick or reimplement as needed\n- Existing components: EpicProgress, AgentTimeline, LoopControlPanel, LogViewer, ProgressBar, MetricCard\n- Existing routes: epics._index.tsx, epics.$epicId.tsx (keep as-is or evolve)\n- Design tokens: apps/ralph-monitoring/docs/DESIGN_LANGUAGE.md\n- UI primitives: apps/ralph-monitoring/app/components/ui/*\n\nKey principles:\n- Mobile-first layout: stack vertically, large tap targets, minimal chrome\n- Information hierarchy: status → current task → recent activity → all steps\n- SSE streaming for live log view (existing LogViewer pattern)\n- Auto-refresh on loop detail (existing 5s revalidation pattern)\n- Calm, technical UI per design language: neutral surfaces, compact density"
