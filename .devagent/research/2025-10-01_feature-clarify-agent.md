- Research Topic: What would make an effective Feature Clarify Agent for guiding and clarifying requirements

## Request Overview

Research and identify what would make an effective Feature Clarify Agent that helps guide and clarify requirements within our existing agent ecosystem. This agent would help bridge the gap between initial ideas and well-formed specs by asking clarifying questions and ensuring requirements are complete before formal specification work begins. The goal is to understand where requirements clarification fits in the workflow, what capabilities it should have, and what structured outputs would prepare requirements for SpecArchitect.

## Research Questions

| ID | Question | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| RQ1 | What are the key capabilities of effective requirements clarification processes in product development? | Answered | Industry practices reviewed |
| RQ2 | What types of questions and frameworks help uncover incomplete or ambiguous requirements? | Answered | Question frameworks identified |
| RQ3 | Where does requirements clarification fit in the workflow relative to brainstorming, research, and spec work? | Answered | Gap identified between brainstorm/research and spec |
| RQ4 | What structured outputs make clarified requirements actionable for downstream agents (ResearchAgent, SpecArchitect)? | Answered | Template alignment analyzed |
| RQ5 | How do leading product development methodologies handle requirements elicitation and validation? | Answered | Best practices synthesized |

## Summary

A Feature Clarify Agent would operate as a **requirements completeness and validation layer** between initial feature ideas (from FeatureBrainstormAgent or ad-hoc requests) and formal specification work (SpecArchitect). Its primary role is to conduct structured inquiry sessions that surface ambiguities, validate assumptions, ensure completeness across key dimensions (users, success metrics, constraints, scope), and produce spec-ready requirement packets that SpecArchitect can consume with minimal rework.

## Key Findings

### 1. Workflow Position & Purpose

**Current state:** The workflow has potential gaps in requirements clarity:
- Ideas may come from FeatureBrainstormAgent (prioritized candidates) or ad-hoc requests
- ResearchAgent gathers evidence but doesn't validate completeness of the original request
- SpecArchitect expects "validated product missions and research packets" but has no formal validation step
- Missing: A systematic process to ensure requirements are complete and unambiguous before investing in research and spec work

**Ideal placement:**
- **Primary position:** After FeatureBrainstormAgent (or initial feature idea) and before ResearchAgent/SpecArchitect
- **Secondary position:** Can be invoked mid-stream when SpecArchitect identifies gaps (escalation path)
- **Parallel operation:** Can work alongside ResearchAgent to clarify evidence needs

**Value proposition:**
- Prevents incomplete requirements from propagating downstream
- Reduces rework in spec and implementation phases
- Ensures all stakeholders align on what's being built before heavy investment
- Creates traceable record of requirement decisions

**Citation:** SpecArchitect workflow analysis (`.devagent/agents/SpecArchitect.md`), industry best practices

### 2. Core Capabilities from Industry Best Practices

**Essential capabilities identified:**

**A. Requirements Elicitation Techniques:**
- **Structured questioning frameworks:** 5 Whys (root cause), INVEST criteria (user stories), clarifying questions template
- **Multi-stakeholder engagement:** Facilitate alignment across developers, users, business stakeholders
- **Active listening patterns:** Paraphrase, confirm understanding, probe for unstated assumptions
- **Scenario-based exploration:** "Walk me through how a user would..." to uncover workflow details

**B. Completeness Validation:**
- **Template-driven checks:** Ensure all critical dimensions are addressed (who, what, why, success metrics, constraints)
- **Gap detection:** Identify missing information across key spec sections (from spec template analysis)
- **Assumption surfacing:** Make implicit assumptions explicit and assign ownership for validation
- **Dependency mapping:** Uncover technical, organizational, and timeline dependencies

**C. Ambiguity Detection:**
- **Vague language identification:** Flag words like "better," "easy," "fast" without quantification
- **Conflicting statements:** Detect contradictions between stated requirements
- **Undefined terms:** Identify domain-specific or ambiguous terminology needing definition
- **Scope clarity:** Ensure clear boundaries between in-scope and out-of-scope

**D. Prioritization Support:**
- **MoSCoW framework:** Must-have, Should-have, Could-have, Won't-have classification
- **Impact vs. Effort assessment:** Help stakeholders understand tradeoffs
- **Constraint validation:** Verify timeline, technical, compliance constraints are realistic

**E. AI-Enhanced Capabilities:**
- **Automated summarization:** Distill long stakeholder inputs into structured requirements
- **Pattern recognition:** Identify similar requirements from past projects to suggest completeness checks
- **Question generation:** AI-generated clarifying questions based on requirement type
- **Consistency checking:** Automated detection of contradictions or gaps

### 3. Structured Outputs for Downstream Agents

To be actionable for SpecArchitect and ResearchAgent, ClarifyAgent outputs must align with expected inputs.

**Analysis of SpecArchitect requirements (from `.devagent/agents/SpecArchitect.md`):**

SpecArchitect expects:
- Approved mission summary or spec request
- Latest research packet links
- Known constraints (timeline, compliance, platform)
- Target review window

SpecArchitect template sections (from `.devagent/templates/spec-document-template.md`):
- Summary (problem, solution direction, why now)
- Context & Problem
- Objectives & Success Metrics
- Users & Insights
- Solution Principles
- Scope Definition (in/out)
- Functional Narrative (flows, acceptance criteria)
- Technical Notes & Dependencies
- Risks & Open Questions

**Recommended ClarifyAgent output structure:**

**1. Clarified Requirement Packet** (stored in `.devagent/features/_clarification/YYYY-MM-DD_<feature-slug>.md` or similar):

```markdown
## Feature Overview
- Feature name/slug
- Requestor and stakeholders
- Business context/trigger

## Validated Requirements

### Problem Statement
- What problem are we solving?
- Who experiences this problem?
- Why is this important now?
- [Validation status: Confirmed by <stakeholder>]

### Success Criteria
- Measurable outcomes (product, business, user)
- Baseline and target metrics
- Definition of done
- [Validation status: ...]

### Users & Personas
- Primary users
- Secondary users
- User needs/jobs to be done
- Key insights/demand signals
- [Validation status: ...]

### Constraints

- Validation method

## Gaps Requiring Research
- Questions for #ResearchAgent
- Evidence needed before spec
- Areas requiring deeper investigation

## Clarification Session Log
- Questions asked
- Answers received
- Stakeholders consulted
- Unresolved ambiguities

## Next Steps
- Ready for spec? (Yes/No + rationale)
- Research tasks required
- Additional stakeholders to consult
```

**2. Handoff artifacts:**
- For **SpecArchitect**: Requirement packet + confirmation that all template sections have source material
- For **ResearchAgent**: Specific research questions derived from gaps/assumptions
- For **ProductMissionPartner**: Mission alignment confirmation or escalation for conflicts

### 4. Integration with Existing System

**Key integration points:**

**Inputs:**
- Feature ideas from FeatureBrainstormAgent (prioritized candidates)
- Ad-hoc feature requests from stakeholders
- Mission artifacts (`product/mission.md`, `roadmap.md`)
- Constitution clauses (`.devagent/memory/constitution.md`)
- Spec template (`.devagent/templates/spec-document-template.md`) as completeness checklist

**Outputs:**
- Clarified requirement packets in `.devagent/features/YYYY-MM-DD_feature-slug/clarification/` or `.devagent/features/_clarification/`
- Research question lists for #ResearchAgent
- Spec readiness assessment for #SpecArchitect
- Updated `guiding-questions.md` when unresolved

**Collaboration patterns:**
- **Invoked by:** FeatureBrainstormAgent (to validate prioritized ideas), ProductMissionPartner (to refine roadmap items), SpecArchitect (when gaps discovered)
- **Invokes:** ResearchAgent (to fill evidence gaps), ProductMissionPartner (for mission alignment)
- **Feeds:** SpecArchitect (with validated, complete requirements), decision journal (for requirement decisions)

**Guardrails:**
- Must respect constitution principles
- Cannot make technical decisions (that's for SpecArchitect/TaskPlanner)
- Cannot commit to delivery dates or scope without stakeholder approval
- Must surface rather than resolve conflicts between stakeholders

### 5. Operating Modes

**Proposed modes:**

**A. Feature Clarification (primary mode):**
- **Trigger:** New feature idea needs validation before spec/research
- **Inputs:** Feature concept, initial problem statement, known stakeholders
- **Process:** Structured question session covering all key dimensions
- **Output:** Complete requirement packet with validation status per section
- **Duration:** 1-3 sessions depending on complexity

**B. Gap Filling (escalation mode):**
- **Trigger:** SpecArchitect or ResearchAgent identifies missing requirements
- **Inputs:** Existing partial spec/research, specific gaps identified
- **Process:** Targeted questioning on missing dimensions only
- **Output:** Gap-fill supplement to existing artifacts
- **Duration:** Single focused session

**C. Requirements Review (validation mode):**
- **Trigger:** Existing requirements document needs validation check
- **Inputs:** Draft requirements or spec
- **Process:** Automated + manual completeness/ambiguity scan
- **Output:** Validation report with flagged issues and recommended clarifications
- **Duration:** Automated scan + follow-up session if issues found

## Detailed Findings

### Requirements Clarification Question Frameworks

Industry-proven question patterns for uncovering incomplete or ambiguous requirements:

#### 1. Problem Validation Questions
- What specific problem are we solving?
- Who experiences this problem and in what context?
- How do they currently work around this problem?
- What evidence do we have that this problem is worth solving?
- Why is solving this problem important right now?
- What happens if we don't solve this problem?

#### 2. User & Stakeholder Questions
- Who are the primary users/beneficiaries?
- Who are secondary/indirect users?
- What are their goals/jobs to be done?
- What user research or feedback supports this?
- Who are the key stakeholders beyond users?
- Who has decision authority on scope/tradeoffs?

#### 3. Success Criteria Questions
- How will we measure success?
- What are the baseline metrics?
- What are the target metrics and timeframes?
- What does "good enough" look like for v1?
- What would make this a failure?
- How will we know when to stop iterating?

#### 4. Scope Definition Questions
- What capabilities MUST be in v1? (Must-have)
- What capabilities SHOULD be in v1? (Should-have)
- What capabilities COULD be in v1? (Could-have)
- What capabilities are explicitly out of scope? (Won't-have)
- What are we NOT building and why?
- What scenarios are edge cases vs. core flows?

#### 5. Constraint Validation Questions
- What are the hard timeline constraints?
- What are the technical constraints/dependencies?
- What are the compliance/legal requirements?
- What are the resource constraints (team, budget)?
- What are the platform/browser/device requirements?

### Ambiguity Detection Patterns

**Common ambiguity types to flag:**

1. **Quantification missing:**
   - "Fast" â†’ How fast? (ms, seconds, perceived?)
   - "Easy to use" â†’ Measured how? (task completion time, error rate, satisfaction score?)
   - "Scalable" â†’ To what scale? (users, requests/sec, data volume?)

2. **Subject unclear:**
   - "They need this feature" â†’ Who specifically is "they"?
   - "The system should..." â†’ Which system/component?

3. **Temporal ambiguity:**
   - "Soon" â†’ By when specifically?
   - "Eventually" â†’ In what phase/milestone?
   - "Real-time" â†’ Within what latency threshold?

4. **Conditional gaps:**
   - "If possible" â†’ What makes it possible/impossible?
   - "Depending on resources" â†’ What resources and how much?

5. **Undefined terms:**
   - Domain-specific jargon without definition
   - Acronyms without expansion
   - Assumed shared understanding

6. **Logical conflicts:**
   - Mutually exclusive requirements
   - Contradictory success metrics
   - Incompatible constraints

**Automated detection approach:**
- Maintain list of ambiguity trigger words
- Flag requirements with these patterns for clarification
- Suggest specific questions to resolve each type

### Change Impact Analysis

When requirements change during clarification (common scenario), ClarifyAgent should:

1. **Document the change:**
   - Original requirement
   - Updated requirement
   - Rationale for change
   - Stakeholder who approved change

2. **Assess downstream impact:**
   - Does this affect existing research?
   - Does this affect existing specs?
   - Does this affect mission alignment?
   - Does this affect other in-flight features?

3. **Update traceability:**
   - Mark affected sections in requirement packet
   - Notify affected agents (ResearchAgent, SpecArchitect)
   - Update decision journal

4. **Validate consistency:**
   - Check for new conflicts with other requirements
   - Verify constraints are still satisfied
   - Confirm success metrics still achievable

**Citation:** Atlassian change management practices, DevAgent decision journal patterns

### AI-Enhanced Clarification

**How AI can augment the clarification process:**

1. **Question generation:**
   - Analyze partial requirements and suggest relevant questions from framework
   - Identify which template sections lack coverage
   - Generate stakeholder-specific question sets

2. **Pattern matching:**
   - Compare to similar past features
   - Suggest common requirements often overlooked
   - Identify reusable solution patterns

3. **Summarization:**
   - Distill long stakeholder conversations into structured requirements
   - Extract key decisions from meeting transcripts
   - Highlight areas of agreement vs. disagreement

4. **Consistency checking:**
   - Detect contradictions between requirements
   - Flag scope creep relative to original problem statement
   - Validate alignment with mission and constitution

5. **Completeness scoring:**
   - Assess requirement packet against template
   - Provide readiness score for spec work
   - Identify highest-priority gaps to address

## Implications for Implementation

### Recommended Agent Design

#### Mission Statement
**Primary goal:** Conduct structured requirement clarification sessions that validate completeness, surface ambiguities, and produce spec-ready requirement packets for SpecArchitect, while maintaining traceability of all requirement decisions and assumptions.

**Boundaries:** Do not make technical architecture decisions (that's SpecArchitect/TaskPlanner), do not conduct evidence-based research (that's ResearchAgent), do not commit to delivery dates or resource allocation. Focus on requirement completeness and clarity validation.

**Success signals:** SpecArchitect can draft specs without major requirement gaps, stakeholders agree on what's being built before spec work begins, requirement decisions are traceable, and rework due to unclear requirements decreases.

#### Key Differentiators for DevAgent Context

1. **Template-driven validation:** Uses spec template as completeness checklist to ensure all SpecArchitect inputs are ready
2. **Constitution-aligned:** Validates requirements against constitution clauses and mission principles
3. **Research-aware:** Distinguishes between clarifiable requirements (can ask stakeholders) and researchable questions (need evidence from ResearchAgent)
4. **Assumption tracking:** Explicit capture and ownership of assumptions for later validation
5. **Lightweight and traceable:** Quick validation cycles with full decision trail

#### Suggested Workflow

1. **Kickoff:**
   - Receive feature concept (from FeatureBrainstormAgent, ad-hoc request, or escalation)
   - Identify stakeholders and decision makers
   - Confirm clarification scope (full feature vs. gap-fill)

2. **Initial assessment:**
   - Review existing materials (brainstorm packet, initial request, related features)
   - Identify obvious gaps using template as checklist
   - Prepare question set covering all key dimensions

3. **Structured inquiry session:**
   - Work through question framework systematically
   - Document answers and probe for ambiguities
   - Surface and log assumptions
   - Identify conflicts for stakeholder resolution

4. **Completeness validation:**
   - Check requirement packet against spec template sections
   - Flag remaining gaps
   - Assess readiness for spec/research work
   - Generate completeness score

5. **Gap triage:**
   - Classify gaps: clarifiable (can ask stakeholders) vs. researchable (need evidence)
   - Formulate research questions for ResearchAgent
   - Schedule follow-up clarification if needed

6. **Output packaging:**
   - Create clarified requirement packet
   - Document assumption log
   - Generate research question list
   - Provide spec readiness assessment

7. **Handoff:**
   - For spec-ready requirements: hand to SpecArchitect with packet
   - For research-needed requirements: hand to ResearchAgent with questions
   - For mission conflicts: escalate to ProductMissionPartner
   - Log decisions in decision journal

8. **Iteration:**
   - If new information surfaces (from research or stakeholders), update requirement packet
   - Track changes and assess impact
   - Re-validate completeness

#### Storage Strategy

**Recommended directory structure:**

```
.devagent/features/YYYY-MM-DD_feature-slug/
  clarification/
    YYYY-MM-DD_initial-clarification.md
    YYYY-MM-DD_gap-fill-session.md
    assumptions-log.md
```

This placement makes sense because:
- Clarification is feature-specific work
- It lives alongside research and spec in the feature hub
- Easy to trace from requirement â†’ research â†’ spec â†’ tasks
- Can reference in spec and research artifacts

**Alternative for pre-feature work:**
```
.devagent/features/_clarification/
  YYYY-MM-DD_<topic>.md
```

Use when feature slug not yet determined (early exploration).
