# Progress Tracker Integration Research

- Owner: DevAgent Team
- Last Updated: 2025-10-20
- Status: Completed
- Related Feature Hub: `.devagent/workspace/features/2025-10-20_progress-tracker/`
- Stakeholders: DevAgent Team

## Summary
Research into additional files and workflows that should integrate with the new AGENTS.md progress tracker. Focused on create-spec, plan-tasks, and create-task-prompt workflows, plus broader integration patterns.

## Context & Problem
The progress tracker feature introduces AGENTS.md as a central progress hub for feature work. Existing workflows that create or update artifacts in feature directories need to be updated to maintain continuity in AGENTS.md.

## Objectives & Success Metrics
- Identify workflows requiring AGENTS.md integration
- Determine update patterns for each workflow
- Ensure no gaps in progress tracking

## Users & Insights
- Primary: Workflow agents that create feature artifacts
- Insights: Workflows should append progress entries to AGENTS.md Progress Log section upon completion

## Solution Principles
- Append-only updates to AGENTS.md
- Include date, event description, and file links
- Update summary status if needed

## Scope Definition
- In Scope: Update templates (spec, task plan, task prompt) with progress tracking instructions for agents
- Out of Scope: Modifying workflow definitions; general research workflows

## Functional Narrative
Agents executing tasks from specs, task plans, and task prompts review AGENTS.md for progress and update it upon completion, ensuring decentralized progress tracking.

## Key Findings
1. **Template-Based Approach**: Instead of modifying workflows, add progress tracking instructions to templates (spec, task plan, task prompt). Agents executing from these documents will update AGENTS.md Progress Log and Implementation Checklist upon completion.
2. **Spec Template**: Added progress tracking section instructing agents to review and update AGENTS.md during implementation, including checklist updates.
3. **Task Plan Template**: Includes progress tracking instructions for agents, including checklist updates.
4. **Task Prompt Template**: Includes progress tracking instructions for agents, including checklist updates.
5. **Workflow Updates**: Only review-progress workflow needs to update AGENTS.md directly, as it captures progress snapshots. Other workflows rely on agent execution to update via templates.

## Open Questions
- Should research workflows update AGENTS.md for feature-specific research?
- Are there other workflows not covered that create feature artifacts?

## Recommendations
- Ensure all templates (spec, task plan, task prompt) include progress tracking instructions for agents to review and update AGENTS.md Progress Log and Implementation Checklist.
- Revert workflow modifications and rely on agent execution for updates.
- Test agent execution to verify AGENTS.md updates occur as expected.
