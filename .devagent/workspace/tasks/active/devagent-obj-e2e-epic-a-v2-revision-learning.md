**Revision Learning:**
**Category**: Process
**Priority**: Low
**Issue**: Epic "Create static data" (v2) had no explicit acceptance criteria in the task payload; the deliverable was inferred from the child engineering task and prior epic (obj-e2e-epic-a) artifacts.
**Recommendation**: When defining epics that duplicate or re-run prior work, add acceptance criteria at epic level (e.g. "obj-e2e-data.json exists with { \"status\": \"ok\" }") so PM/QA can verify without relying only on child task descriptions.
**Files/Rules Affected**: Objective/epic setup workflow, Beads task creation for e2e epics
