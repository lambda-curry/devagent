# Draft Constitution Clause: Simplicity Over Rigidity

## Proposed Clause C6

### C6. Simplicity Over Rigidity
- **Statement:** Prefer simpler, more natural flows over rigid, prescriptive structures. Avoid dictating overly precise processes when concise, flexible prompting achieves the same goal. Favor natural progression (e.g., analyze → act → validate) over artificial phase boundaries. Use checklists and frameworks as guides for completeness, not mandates for systematic coverage. When in doubt, choose the simpler approach that maintains effectiveness.
- **Steward:** AgentBuilder.
- **Refresh cadence:** Review quarterly or when workflow complexity becomes a friction point.
- **Traceability:** Workflow definitions should demonstrate natural flow; overly prescriptive structures should be simplified. Task hubs should reference this clause when simplifying workflows.

## Rationale

This clause addresses the tendency to create overly structured, rigid workflows that feel regimented rather than helpful. The clarify workflow redesign revealed that:
- Artificial phase boundaries (e.g., "Phase 1: Inquiry, Phase 2: Validation") add unnecessary complexity
- Natural flows (analyze context → ask targeted questions → check completeness) are simpler and more effective
- Prescriptive requirements (e.g., "visit all 8 dimensions systematically") create friction
- Flexible, gap-driven approaches with lightweight validation achieve the same completeness with less rigidity

## Impacted Clauses
- None (new clause)

- Research finding: Workflow is template-driven rather than gap-driven, creating friction
- Solution: Simplify to natural gap-driven flow without artificial phases

## Amendment Proposal
Add C6 to constitution following standard amendment process.

## Approval
- **Approved by:** Jake Ruesink (AgentBuilder steward)
- **Date:** 2026-01-14
- **Status:** ✅ Added to constitution
