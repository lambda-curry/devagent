Revision Learning:
**Category**: Process
**Priority**: Low
**Issue**: Epic-level verification task worked smoothly. The main objective "Create static data" was completed by child task `devagent-obj-e2e-epic-a.1`, and verification confirmed completion with all quality gates passing.
**Recommendation**: Continue using this pattern for epic-level verification tasks. The epic lifecycle management protocol correctly keeps the epic `in_progress` until wrap-up tasks complete, which maintains proper dependency tracking.
**Files/Rules Affected**: Epic lifecycle management protocol (C6)
