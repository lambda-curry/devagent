Revision Learning:
**Category**: Process
**Priority**: Low
**Issue**: QA task had no prior comments; verification was done entirely from implementation and tests. A short "Plan document" or handoff note on the implementation task (devagent-mobile-epic-activity-2026-02-03.2) would help QA know which test files and criteria map to each acceptance item.
**Recommendation**: When closing engineering tasks that have a follow-up QA task, add a brief comment listing test paths and how they map to acceptance criteria (optional but speeds QA verification).
**Files/Rules Affected**: Beads workflow / task handoff
