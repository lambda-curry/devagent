Revision Learning:
**Category**: Process
**Priority**: Low
**Issue**: Final review task combined "final review" (verification) with "documentation update." README and component-specs were not updated incrementally as each feature (EpicMetaCard, EpicActivity, EpicCommitList, EpicLogPanel) landed, so the doc update was done in one batch at the end.
**Recommendation**: In epic plans, add a doc-update checkpoint after each feature task (or a single "docs: update README/component-specs" subtask) so docs stay in sync with code.
**Files/Rules Affected**: README.md, docs/component-specs.md; Ralph task-setup / final-review workflow.
