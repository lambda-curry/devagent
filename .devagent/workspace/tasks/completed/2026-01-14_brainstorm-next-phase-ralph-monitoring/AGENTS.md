## Summary
Come up with ideas for the next phase of the ralph-monitoring app so we can test ralph again. The goal is to brainstorm new features, enhancements, or directions for the ralph-monitoring application that will provide meaningful work for testing Ralph's capabilities. This task involves generating creative ideas and exploring possibilities for expanding the monitoring UI beyond its current MVP state, with the intention of using these ideas as a testbed for Ralph's autonomous development capabilities.

## Agent Update Instructions
