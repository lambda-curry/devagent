## Commit: 61ea05b1 - chore(ai-rules): configure platform targets for all required agents

## Summary
Successfully configured `ai-rules/ai-rules-config.yaml` to generate rules for all required platforms:
- **AGENTS.md** (for Opencode) - Generated by agents: copilot, amp, codex, goose
- **CLAUDE.md** - Generated by claude agent
- **.cursor/rules/** - Generated by cursor agent (6 .mdc files)
- **.github/copilot-instructions.md** - Created as symlink to AGENTS.md (ai-rules CLI doesn't directly support this path)

All acceptance criteria met. The `ai-rules generate` command now produces all required platform-specific files.

## Verification
- ✅ `ai-rules generate` produces AGENTS.md
- ✅ `ai-rules generate` produces CLAUDE.md
- ✅ `ai-rules generate` produces .cursor/rules/ (6 files)
- ✅ `.github/copilot-instructions.md` exists (symlink to AGENTS.md)
- ✅ `ai-rules status` shows all agents in sync
- ✅ Quality gates: typecheck, lint, test all passed

## Revision Learning
**Category**: Process
**Priority**: Low
**Issue**: The ai-rules CLI generates `AGENTS.md` for the `copilot` agent, but GitHub Copilot can also use `.github/copilot-instructions.md`. The CLI doesn't directly support generating `.github/copilot-instructions.md`.

**Recommendation**: Created a symlink from `.github/copilot-instructions.md` to `AGENTS.md` to support both conventions. This ensures GitHub Copilot can find instructions regardless of which file path it checks. Consider documenting this pattern in the project README or ai-rules documentation.

**Files/Rules Affected**: 
- `ai-rules/ai-rules-config.yaml` (new config file)
- `.github/copilot-instructions.md` (symlink)
