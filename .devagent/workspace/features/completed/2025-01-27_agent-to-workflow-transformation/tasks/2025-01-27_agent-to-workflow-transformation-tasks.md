# Agent-to-Workflow Transformation Task Plan

- Owner: TaskPlanner
- Last Updated: 2025-01-27
- Status: Draft
- Related Spec: `.devagent/workspace/features/2025-01-27_agent-to-workflow-transformation/spec/2025-01-27_agent-to-workflow-transformation-spec.md`
- Notes: Transform all 10 existing agents to workflows while maintaining 100% functional parity and improving model recognition
- File Location: `.devagent/workspace/features/2025-01-27_agent-to-workflow-transformation/tasks/2025-01-27_agent-to-workflow-transformation-tasks.md`

## Summary
Transform the current agent-based DevAgent system (using `#AgentName` triggers) into a workflow-based system using `devagent [workflow-name]` triggers. This addresses model recognition issues where hashtag triggers aren't reliably recognized, requiring users to say "devagent" at the beginning. The transformation will improve usability, consistency, and model recognition while maintaining all existing functionality.

## Scope & Assumptions
- Scope focus: Complete transformation of all 10 existing agents to workflows
- Key assumptions: 
  - All existing agent functionality must be preserved
  - Model recognition will improve with natural language triggers
  - Users will adopt new workflow syntax within 1 week
  - No backwards compatibility or migration path needed
- Out of scope: 
  - New workflow capabilities beyond existing agents
  - Changes to core DevAgent architecture
  - Integration with external systems
  - Performance optimizations

## Tasks

### Task 1: Update Core Documentation Structure
- Objective: Transform AGENTS.md from agent-based to workflow-based structure
- Dependencies: Spec approval, current AGENTS.md analysis
- Acceptance Criteria: 
  - AGENTS.md updated with workflow-based approach
  - All 10 agents mapped to workflow names
  - Clear workflow trigger patterns documented
  - Backward compatibility noted
- Subtasks:
  1. `Analyze current AGENTS.md structure` — Review existing agent descriptions and trigger patterns
     - Acceptance: Complete inventory of current agents and their descriptions
  2. `Design workflow naming convention` — Create intuitive, descriptive workflow names
     - Acceptance: 10 workflow names that are clear and memorable
  3. `Update AGENTS.md with workflow structure` — Replace agent-based content with workflow-based content
     - Acceptance: AGENTS.md reflects new workflow approach with examples
- Validation plan: Manual review of updated AGENTS.md for completeness and clarity

### Task 2: Transform Agent Files to Workflow Format
- Objective: Rename and update all agent files to workflow format
- Dependencies: Task 1 completion, workflow naming convention
- Acceptance Criteria:
  - All 10 agent files renamed to workflow format
  - File contents updated to reflect workflow approach
  - Internal references updated
- Subtasks:
  1. `Rename agent files to workflow names` — Update file names in `.devagent/core/agents/`
     - Acceptance: All files renamed with consistent workflow naming
  2. `Update file contents for workflow approach` — Modify each file to use workflow terminology
     - Acceptance: All files reference workflows instead of agents
  3. `Update internal cross-references` — Fix references between workflow files
     - Acceptance: No broken internal references
- Validation plan: File system check and content review for consistency

### Task 3: Create Workflow Trigger Examples and Documentation
- Objective: Develop comprehensive examples and documentation for new workflow triggers
- Dependencies: Task 2 completion, workflow structure finalized
- Acceptance Criteria:
  - Clear trigger examples for each workflow
  - Usage documentation created
  - Common workflow chains documented
- Subtasks:
  1. `Create individual workflow trigger examples` — Document `devagent [workflow-name]` usage for each workflow
     - Acceptance: At least 3 examples per workflow
  2. `Document common workflow chains` — Show how workflows work together
     - Acceptance: Examples of multi-workflow sequences
- Validation plan: Documentation review and user testing

### Task 4: Update Internal References and Dependencies
- Objective: Ensure all internal references point to new workflow structure
- Dependencies: Tasks 1-3 completion
- Acceptance Criteria:
  - All internal references updated
  - No broken links or references
  - Consistent terminology throughout
- Subtasks:
  1. `Audit all internal references` — Find all references to old agent names
     - Acceptance: Complete list of files needing updates
  2. `Update reference files` — Fix all identified references
     - Acceptance: All references point to new workflow names
  3. `Validate consistency` — Ensure terminology is consistent across all files
     - Acceptance: No mixed terminology (agents vs workflows)
- Validation plan: Automated reference checking and manual review

### Task 5: Testing and Validation
- Objective: Test workflow triggers and validate functional parity
- Dependencies: Tasks 1-4 completion
- Acceptance Criteria:
  - Workflow triggers tested with multiple models
  - Functional parity confirmed with existing agents
  - Model recognition improvement validated
- Subtasks:
  1. `Test workflow trigger recognition` — Verify models recognize `devagent [workflow-name]` triggers
     - Acceptance: Models recognize triggers without "devagent" prefix requirement
  2. `Validate functional parity` — Ensure workflows produce same output as agents
     - Acceptance: Output quality matches or exceeds current agent performance
  3. `User acceptance testing` — Test with actual users
     - Acceptance: Users can successfully use new workflow syntax
- Validation plan: Multi-model testing and user feedback collection

### Task 6: Final Documentation and Cleanup
- Objective: Complete documentation updates and final validation
- Dependencies: Task 5 completion
- Acceptance Criteria:
  - All documentation updated and reviewed
  - System ready for immediate use
- Subtasks:
  1. `Update README.md and related docs` — Ensure all documentation reflects workflow approach
     - Acceptance: All docs updated with workflow terminology
  2. `Final validation and sign-off` — Complete system validation
     - Acceptance: All success metrics met, system ready for use
- Validation plan: Final review and approval process

## Risks & Dependencies
- Model recognition improvement not achieved: Test with multiple models, iterate on trigger patterns
- Workflow name conflicts or confusion: User testing, clear naming conventions
- Internal reference updates missed: Comprehensive audit, automated checks

## Success Metrics
- Models recognize `devagent [workflow-name]` triggers without requiring "devagent" prefix
- All existing agent functionality preserved and accessible
- User adoption of new workflow syntax within 1 week
