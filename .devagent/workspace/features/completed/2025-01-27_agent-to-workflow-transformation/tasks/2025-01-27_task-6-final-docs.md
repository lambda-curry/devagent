## Product Context
- Problem statement: Final documentation updates are needed to ensure all documentation reflects the new workflow approach and the system is ready for immediate use.
- Customer impact: Users need complete, accurate documentation to successfully use the transformed workflow system.
- Mission alignment: Complete documentation updates and final validation to ensure system readiness.

## Research Summary
- Key finding: All documentation must reflect workflow approach (spec L111)
- Additional insight: System must be ready for immediate use without migration path (spec L112)

## Task Scope
- Objective: Complete documentation updates and final validation to ensure system readiness.
- Out of scope: File transformations, internal reference updates, testing.
- Dependencies: Task 5 completion.

## Implementation Plan
1. **Update documentation** — Ensure all documentation reflects workflow approach with consistent terminology.
2. **Final validation** — Complete system validation to confirm all success metrics are met and system is ready for use.

## Acceptance Criteria
- All docs updated with workflow terminology
- All success metrics met
- System ready for immediate use
- Final review and approval process completed

## Reference Files
- `README.md` — Main project documentation
- `.devagent/workspace/features/2025-01-27_agent-to-workflow-transformation/tasks/2025-01-27_task-5-testing-validation.md` — Testing results
- `.devagent/workspace/features/2025-01-27_agent-to-workflow-transformation/spec/2025-01-27_agent-to-workflow-transformation-spec.md` — Success metrics

## Constraints
- Must update all relevant documentation
- Must ensure system readiness
- No migration path needed

## Deliverables
1. Updated documentation — all docs reflect workflow approach
2. Final validation report — confirmation of system readiness
3. Approval documentation — sign-off and completion confirmation

## Task Pack
| task-id | description | ai_prompt | status | file_hints | context_refs |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| task-6-docs | Update README.md and related docs | Update README.md and any other relevant documentation to reflect the new workflow approach.
