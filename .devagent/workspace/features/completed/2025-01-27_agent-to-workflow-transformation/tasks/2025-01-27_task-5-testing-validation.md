## Product Context
- Problem statement: The transformed workflow system needs validation to ensure it works correctly and achieves the goal of improved model recognition.
- Customer impact: Users need confidence that the new workflow system will work reliably and provide better model recognition than the old agent system.
- Mission alignment: Validate that the transformation achieves 100% functional parity and improves model recognition.

## Research Summary
- Key finding: Model recognition improvement is the primary objective (spec L19)
- Additional insight: Functional parity must be maintained while improving recognition (spec L20)

## Task Scope
- Objective: Create automated validation scripts and test harnesses for workflow system.
- Out of scope: Manual testing, user acceptance testing, documentation updates.
- Dependencies: Tasks 1-4 completion.

## Implementation Plan
1. **Create validation scripts** — Build automated scripts to test workflow trigger patterns and validate syntax.
2. **Build test harnesses** — Create test infrastructure to validate workflow functionality and output quality.
3. **Implement automated checks** — Add automated validation to ensure workflow system integrity.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Automated validation scripts created and functional
- Test harnesses validate workflow trigger patterns
- Automated checks ensure system integrity
- All validation code is executable and maintainable

## Reference Files
- `.devagent/core/workflows/` — Transformed workflow files for testing
- `.devagent/workspace/features/2025-01-27_agent-to-workflow-transformation/tasks/2025-01-27_task-3-trigger-examples.md` — Trigger examples for testing
- `.devagent/workspace/features/2025-01-27_agent-to-workflow-transformation/spec/2025-01-27_agent-to-workflow-transformation-spec.md` — Success metrics

## Constraints
- Must create executable validation code
- Must validate workflow trigger patterns
- Must ensure system integrity

## Deliverables
1. Validation scripts — automated scripts to test workflow triggers
2. Test harnesses — infrastructure to validate workflow functionality
3. Automated checks — system integrity validation code

## Task Pack
| task-id | description | ai_prompt | status | file_hints | context_refs |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| task-5-validation-scripts | Create validation scripts | Create automated scripts to test workflow trigger patterns and validate syntax. Build scripts that can parse and validate `devagent [workflow-name]` trigger patterns, check for proper formatting, and ensure all workflows are accessible. | planned | [`scripts/`] | [`spec.md#L82`, `task-3-trigger-examples.md`] |
| task-5-test-harnesses | Build test harnesses | Create test infrastructure to validate workflow functionality and output quality. Build harnesses that can execute workflows, compare outputs, and validate that all 10 workflows produce expected results. | planned | [`scripts/`] | [`spec.md#L83-84`, `spec.md#L20`] |
| task-5-automated-checks | Implement automated checks | Add automated validation to ensure workflow system integrity. Create checks that validate file structure, reference integrity, and system consistency. Include linting and validation rules. | planned | [`scripts/`] | [`spec.md#L85`, `spec.md#L25`] |

Status values: `planned`, `in_progress`, `blocked`, `ready_for_review`, `done`.
