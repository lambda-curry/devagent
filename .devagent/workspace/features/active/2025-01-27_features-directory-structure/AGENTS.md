# Features Directory Structure Implementation

## Overview
Implement Enhanced Status-Based Structure for features directory with `active/`, `planned/`, `completed/` subdirectories while maintaining chronological organization within each.

## Implementation Checklist
- [ ] Create new status-based directory structure
- [ ] Migrate existing features to appropriate status directories
- [ ] Update workflow files to reference status-based paths
- [ ] Update template files to reference status-based paths
- [ ] Update documentation files with new organizational structure
- [ ] Validate structure meets requirements

## Progress Log
- 2025-01-27T20:00:00Z — Feature hub created with task prompt for implementing Enhanced Status-Based Structure based on brainstorm results. Task prompt includes 4 discrete tasks: create directories, migrate features, update documentation, and validate structure.
- 2025-01-27T21:30:00Z — Reviewed all workflows and templates across the codebase. Created IMPLEMENTATION-CHANGES.md documenting all required updates (8 workflow files, 8 template files, 3 documentation files). Expanded task pack to include workflow and template update tasks (now 6 total tasks). Key finding: Most workflows and templates reference `.devagent/workspace/features/YYYY-MM-DD_feature-slug/` pattern that needs to be updated to include `{status}` placeholder.
