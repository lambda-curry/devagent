**Summary:**
- Ran `verify.sh` (exit 0). Created `results.md` at `.devagent/workspace/tests/wake-hook-test/results.md` with pass summary. All acceptance criteria met; this is the final task so the on-complete hook should fire.

**Verification:**
- `bash .devagent/workspace/tests/wake-hook-test/verify.sh` → exit 0
- `results.md` exists with table and outcome

**Commit:** 81446a13 — chore(wake-hook-test): add verification results summary (devagent-wake-hook-test.3) [skip ci]
