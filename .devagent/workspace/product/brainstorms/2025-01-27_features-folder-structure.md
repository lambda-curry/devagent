# Brainstorm Packet — Features Directory Structure Organization

- Mode: exploratory
- Session Date: 2025-01-27
- Participants: Solo
- Storage Path: `.devagent/workspace/product/brainstorms/2025-01-27_features-folder-structure.md`
- Related Artifacts: 
  - `.devagent/workspace/product/mission.md` (C1: Mission & Stakeholder Fidelity)
  - `.devagent/workspace/memory/constitution.md` (C2: Chronological Feature Artifacts)
  - `.devagent/workspace/features/README.md` (current structure)

## Problem Statement

The current features directory structure uses a flat chronological organization with only `completed/` as a subdirectory. As DevAgent scales and more features move through different lifecycle stages (backlog, in-progress, completed), we need a more sophisticated organization system that:

1. **Maintains chronological traceability** (C2: Chronological Feature Artifacts)
2. **Supports clear workflow states** for different feature lifecycle stages
3. **Enables efficient discovery** of features by status and context
4. **Scales with team growth** and increasing feature volume
5. **Preserves mission alignment** (C1: Mission & Stakeholder Fidelity)

**Brainstorm Mode:** Exploratory — Open-ended ideation for organizing feature lifecycle states

**Known Constraints:**
- Technical: Must work with existing `.devagent/workspace/features/` structure
- Compliance: Must maintain C2 chronological artifact requirements
- Strategic: Aligns with mission of supporting engineering teams with structured AI workflows
- Timeline: Should be implementable without disrupting current active features

## Ideas (Divergent Phase)

## Prioritized Candidates (Top 3-5)

### Candidate 1: Enhanced Status-Based Structure
**Score:** 20
**Description:** Expand current structure with `active/`, `planned/`, `completed/` subdirectories while maintaining chronological organization within each
**Mission Alignment:** Directly supports C2 (Chronological Feature Artifacts) and provides clear workflow states for engineering teams
**Expected Impact:** Immediate clarity on feature status, easier discovery of work in different stages, maintains existing chronological benefits
**Implementation Approach:** 
- Create three main subdirectories: `active/`, `planned/`, `completed/`
- Move existing `completed/` features to new structure
- Maintain date-prefixed naming within each subdirectory (no subfolders)
- Update README.md with new structure documentation
**Key Assumptions:** Teams will consistently move features between status folders as work progresses
**Risks:** Risk of features getting "stuck" in wrong status folder, requires discipline to maintain
**Next Steps:** Research current feature lifecycle patterns and validate status transition points

**Score:** 16
**Description:** Combine status with timeline using `active/`, `planned/`, `completed/` with timeline subfolders
**Mission Alignment:** Supports both workflow clarity and strategic planning alignment
**Expected Impact:** Better strategic visibility while maintaining workflow clarity
**Implementation Approach:**
- Create `active/`, `planned/`, `completed/` main folders
- Add timeline subfolders: `this-quarter/`, `next-quarter/`, `future/`
- Features can exist in both status and timeline dimensions
**Key Assumptions:** Teams can effectively categorize features by both status and timeline
**Risks:** More complex organization may lead to confusion about where features belong

- Features exist in both priority and status dimensions
**Key Assumptions:** Teams can consistently assign and maintain priority levels
**Risks:** Priority may change frequently, creating maintenance overhead
**Next Steps:** Research current prioritization practices and frequency of priority changes
