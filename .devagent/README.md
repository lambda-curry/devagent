# DevAgent Workspace

This directory houses self-referential assets the DevAgent system uses while orchestrating its own build. It mirrors the product → spec → execution stack managed by our internal agents.

- `product/`: Mission, principles, roadmap, and open questions stewarded by ProductMissionPartner.
- `research/`: Packets and references curated by ResearchAgent.
- `specs/`: Draft and approved specs owned by SpecArchitect.
- `tasks/`: Decomposed task lists from TaskPlanner.
- `execution/`: Implementation notes, validation logs, and summaries from Executor.

Keep artifacts lightweight and versioned so the agents can iterate quickly.
