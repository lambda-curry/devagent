# DevAgent Product Mission

## Product
DevAgent is a self-reflective agent workspace that helps engineering teams design, plan, and execute software projects while continuously improving its own workflows.

## Who
Primary users are small to mid-sized product teams and individual maintainers who want lightweight, AI-assisted delivery processes without adopting heavyweight ALM suites.

## Problem
Teams struggle to keep research, specs, tasks, and execution aligned, especially when experimenting with AI agents. Context scatters across docs and tools, slowing feedback and eroding trust in automated assistance.

## Why Now
Agent frameworks and orchestration patterns have matured enough to codify best practices. Capturing them in a self-hosted workspace lets teams bootstrap quickly and gives DevAgent a real project to refine itself against.

## Solution
Ship a modular roster of agents (ResearchAgent, SpecArchitect, TaskPlanner, Executor, ProductMissionPartner) that share structured artifacts under `.devagent/`. Each agent runs guided interviews or automations to keep the mission, specs, tasks, and implementation history up to date.

## Metrics
- Cut concept-to-spec cycle time to under 2 working days for pilot features.
- Maintain â‰¥80% completion rate for planned tasks per iteration.
- Capture at least three validated learnings per month inside `product/open-questions.md` or mission updates.
- Reduce manual doc handoffs by 50% versus baseline process within one quarter.

## Unresolved Questions
See `open-questions.md` for discovery items surfaced during the mission workshop.
