# DevAgent Product Mission

## Product
DevAgent provides a reusable roster of agent-ready prompts and workflows that let engineering teams plug AI support into their existing tools, driving faster delivery without sacrificing shared missions, specs, or code quality expectations.

## Who
Primary sponsors are engineering managers at Lambda Curry guiding teams with uneven AI proficiency. They need a structured way to help every developer tap AI agents confidently while preserving the team's standards.

## Problem
Today's AI usage feels open-ended and ad hoc. Engineers steeped in traditional workflows struggle to hand off context, prompting remains inconsistent, and agent outputs rarely compound into reusable project knowledge, dragging down speed and quality.

## Why Now
Peer teams are already operationalizing AI-first development. If we wait six to twelve months, those competitors will outpace us on velocity and polish. Investing now keeps Lambda Curry ahead of that curve and lets our teams deliver more value to clients, faster.

## Solution
Blend the strengths of builder-style agent OS patterns and GitHub's Spec Kit with Lambda Curry's delivery rhythms. Package the prompts and guardrails so teams can adopt individual agents incrementally, yet still gain compounding improvements as more workflows come online.

## Metrics
- **30 days:** Daily coding in DevAgent prompts feels natural for the founders, and at least one additional teammate adopts the workflow on an active project.
- **90 days:** Broader team reports positive feedback on the agent-assisted process and keeps using it without reminders, signaling a sticky workflow.
- **180 days:** The prompt suite is considered indispensable -- teams default to it for new initiatives because it demonstrably improves quality and turnaround time.
