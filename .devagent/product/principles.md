# Delivery Principles

1. **Human-in-the-loop defaults:** Every agent interaction produces drafts that require explicit human confirmation before downstream automation proceeds.
2. **Traceable artifacts:** All agent outputs must link to mission metrics and cite research inputs so stakeholders can audit decisions.
3. **Iterate in thin slices:** Limit planning waves to five tasks and ensure each slice can deliver observable value within a week.
4. **Guardrails before generation:** Establish constraints (tools, permissions, review gates) prior to code generation to prevent scope drift.
5. **Teach by doing:** Prioritize automations that keep DevAgent building DevAgent so the system continuously validates itself.
