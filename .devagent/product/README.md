# Product Layer Assets

ProductMissionPartner uses this space to capture the shared product context that anchors all other workflows.

Artifacts:
- `mission.md`: Canonical product mission (Product, Who, Problem, Why now, Solution, Metrics).
- `principles.md`: Delivery principles and guardrails distilled from stakeholder alignment.
- `roadmap.md`: Milestones translating mission themes into execution horizons.
- `open-questions.md`: Outstanding discovery threads requiring research or stakeholder input.

Update these documents collaboratively with the agents as the product vision evolves.
