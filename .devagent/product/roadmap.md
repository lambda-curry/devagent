# Roadmap Checkpoints

## Near Term (0-4 weeks)
- Package the core prompt suite so founders can rely on it during daily coding sessions.
- Onboard at least one additional teammate and pilot the workflow on a live Lambda Curry project.
- Capture friction logs from the pilot to feed the adoption measurement plan and guiding questions.

## Mid Term (1-2 quarters)
- Codify sticky-workflow signals (surveys, usage logs, velocity deltas) and automate lightweight tracking.
- Publish incremental adoption playbooks that let teams roll out agents one at a time without losing context.
- Integrate prompt updates with mission and spec artifacts so improvements propagate automatically across projects.

## Long Term (>2 quarters)
- Establish the prompt suite as the default starting point for new initiatives across Lambda Curry clients.
- Enable adaptive agent selection that suggests the next workflow to automate based on project telemetry.
- Share a refined toolkit publicly so partner teams can replicate the adoption path and contribute improvements.
