# Roadmap Checkpoints

## Near Term (0-4 weeks)
- Stand up agent execution harness that can invoke roster agents against the `.devagent` workspace.
- Automate mission refresh prompts after major commits touching product or specs.
- Seed research workflow with exemplar packets demonstrating expected format.

## Mid Term (1-2 quarters)
- Integrate CI hooks that run TaskPlanner and Executor simulations on feature branches.
- Publish public templates so other teams can clone DevAgent structure with minimal setup.
- Instrument metrics pipeline to track cycle time and task completion automatically.

## Long Term (>2 quarters)
- Offer adaptive agent selection that reconfigures the roster based on project maturity signals.
- Open-source a plugin system for swapping in custom domain agents without changing the core workspace.
- Achieve “self-improving loop” where mission updates trigger downstream research/tests autonomously.
