## Open Decisions

- <Decision or unknown that needs follow-up>

> Replace placeholders and remove any rows once real data exists.

## Research Artifacts

- Store discovery packets in `research/` using ISO date prefixes and concise suffixes (e.g. `2025-09-29_initial-research.md`).
- Each packet should list guiding questions, summarize sourced findings with freshness notes, and capture open questions plus recommended follow-ups.
- Remove this guidance once the folder contains real artifacts.

## Spec Artifacts

- Publish specs in `spec/` with matching ISO date prefixes (e.g. `2025-10-05_v1-spec.md`).
- Follow the standard structure (Overview, Goals, Non-Goals, Requirements, Acceptance Tests) and point back to the latest research packet.
- Include review notes or revisions as additional dated files; delete this help text after the folder is populated.
