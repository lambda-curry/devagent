# Brainstorm Packet — [Topic]

- Mode: [exploratory | targeted | expansion]
- Session Date: YYYY-MM-DD
- Participants: [Names or "Solo"]
- Storage Path: `.devagent/workspace/product/brainstorms/YYYY-MM-DD_<topic>.md`
- Related Artifacts: [Links to mission, specs, prior brainstorms, or feature hubs]

## Problem Statement

[Clear description of the problem, opportunity, or mission gap being addressed. Include relevant context from mission artifacts and constitution principles.]

**Brainstorm Mode:** [Choose one and describe]
- **Exploratory:** Open-ended ideation from this problem statement
- **Targeted:** Solutions for specific criteria/constraints: [list requirements]
- **Expansion:** Variations on existing feature: [link to baseline concept]

**Known Constraints:**
- Technical: [e.g., must integrate with X, performance requirements]
- Compliance: [e.g., GDPR, accessibility standards]
- Budget/Timeline: [e.g., must ship in Q2, limited resources]
- Strategic: [e.g., aligns with roadmap theme Y]

## Ideas (Divergent Phase)

_Generated using multiple ideation techniques: prompt-based, constraint-based, analogy, SCAMPER, "How Might We", perspective shifts (user, developer, business, technical)._

## Clustered Themes

_Ideas grouped by similarity to identify patterns and reduce redundancy._

### Theme 1: [Theme Name]
**Pattern:** [What these ideas have in common]
**Ideas:** [List of idea numbers/titles in this cluster]

### Theme 2: [Theme Name]
**Pattern:** [What these ideas have in common]
**Ideas:** [List of idea numbers/titles in this cluster]

### Theme 3: [Theme Name]

## Evaluation Matrix

_Scored against mission metrics, constitution principles, and practical constraints._

| Idea/Theme | Mission Alignment | User Impact | Technical Feasibility | Estimated Effort | Total Score | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [Idea 1] | [1-5] | [1-5] | [1-5] | [1-5] | [Sum] | [Key trade-offs, risks] |
| [Idea 2] | [1-5] | [1-5] | [1-5] | [1-5] | [Sum] | [Key trade-offs, risks] |
| ... | | | | | | |

**Scoring Guide:**
- **Mission Alignment:** 1 = Tangential, 5 = Core to stated mission metrics
- **User Impact:** 1 = Minimal, 5 = Transformative for primary user segments
- **Technical Feasibility:** 1 = High risk/complexity, 5 = Straightforward with existing stack
- **Estimated Effort:** 1 = Months/high effort, 5 = Days/low effort (inverted—higher score = less effort)
