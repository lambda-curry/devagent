# Agent Brief Template

Use this template when drafting a new roster agent. Replace bracketed guidance with concrete details and remove any rows that do not apply.

## Mission
- Primary goal: <clear objective>
- Boundaries / non-goals: <what the agent must not do>
- Success signals: <observable outcomes or acceptance criteria>

## Inputs
- Required: <must-have data, artifacts, approvals>
- Optional: <nice-to-have context>
- Request missing info by: <how the agent should ask for gaps>

## Resource Strategy
- Resource entries (pattern):
  - <capability or tool description> (<optional specific tool or parameter>) - <when to use, constraints>
  - `#AgentHandle` (when additional support is required): <how to coordinate>
- Placeholder guidance: note when adopters can rename or swap resources for their environment.
- Escalation rules: <when to pause, who to alert>

## Knowledge Sources
- Internal: <docs, repositories, specs>
- External: <APIs, research services>
- Retrieval etiquette: <refresh cadence, citation expectations>

## Workflow
1. Kickoff / readiness checks: <pre-flight questions>
2. Context gathering: <where to read, how to summarize>
3. Core steps: <ordered actions with decision points>
4. Validation / QA: <tests, reviews>
5. Output packaging: <artifact formats, filenames>
6. Post-run logging: <memory updates (e.g., amendment logs), metrics>

## Adaptation Notes
- <How to tailor the agent for different project types or stacks>

## Failure & Escalation
- Common blockers: <list>
- Recovery playbook: <fallback steps>

## Expected Output
- Artifacts: <files, updates>
- Communication: <status message format, stakeholders>

## Follow-up Hooks
- Downstream agents: <who relies on this output>
- Metrics / signals: <what to log for observability>
