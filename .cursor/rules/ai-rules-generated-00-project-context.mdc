# DevAgent Project — AI Agent Context

This file provides high-level context about the DevAgent project for AI agents.

## What This Project Is

DevAgent is a development workspace system that uses AI workflows to coordinate product work, research, specifications, and implementation. This project uses its own workflow system to develop itself.

## Project Structure

**Key workspace locations:**
- `.devagent/workspace/product/` — Mission, roadmap, and guiding questions for DevAgent
- `.devagent/workspace/tasks/` — Active and completed tasks with research, specs, and plans
- `.devagent/workspace/research/` — General research artifacts
- `.devagent/workspace/memory/` — Constitution, decision journal, and tech stack
- `.devagent/core/` — Portable agent kit (templates, workflow definitions)

## How Workflows Work

Workflows are structured prompt sequences that run inside this environment. You trigger a workflow by writing `devagent [workflow-name]` with required inputs.

**Common Workflows:**
- `devagent new-task` — Start a new task
- `devagent research` — Research a problem
- `devagent create-plan` — Create an implementation plan
- `devagent implement-plan` — Execute the plan
